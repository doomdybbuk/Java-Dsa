The actual meaning of increment and decrement operator is:{
    If int i = 22;
    System.out.println(i++)
    - This means that first i will be printed and then its value is going to increase, Here the output is 22.
    - If instead of i++ it will be ++i then first the value of i will increase  (22 -> 23)
      and then it will be printed so the output will be 23.
    - Same logic goes for decrement operator which is i-- and --i.
