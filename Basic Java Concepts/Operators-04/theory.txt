There are four types of operators:{
    Arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/,%,++,--)
    Assignment operators (=,+=,-+,*=,/=) -> Assignes Values to the variable 
    Comparision operators (==,<=,>=)
    Logical operators (&&,||,!)
    Bitwise operators (&,|)
}
The += means that add the value in the already defined variable:{
    for eg: int b = 9;
    b += 3;
    Output will be 12 ie 9+3 
}
&&{
    Make sures that both conditions are true and if yes then it will give output as true
}
|| {
    Will make sure that either of the condition is true, if yes then it will return true
}
