If we write any decimal value as an input then it automatically it will be assigned as an Double Data Type but in order to give it a Floating data type
we will have to specify it:{
    for eg: float f1= 5.6;(Assigned as double)
            float f2= 4.8f;(Assigned as float)
}
To define a long integer we will also have to provide a "l" at the end of the number in order to specify it as a long data type{
    long ageDino = 72992992939929329l;
}
